        <h3>An Ideal Husband</h3>

        <h5>Act III <br>

            The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
            the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
            smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
            drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
            some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
            impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
            Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his
            intellectual or emotional life_, _history knows nothing_.  _He represents
            the dominance of form_.

            <h5 class="name"> LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech"> Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps?</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">Yes, my lord.<p class="stage-direction" >[_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
                presents new buttonhole on salver_.]</p> 

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech">Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
                of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole. </p>

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5> <p  class="speech"> Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.</p>

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech"> <p class="stage-direction"> [_Taking out old buttonhole_.] </p> You see, Phipps, Fashion is
                what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">Yes, my lord.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech"> Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. </p>

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech"> Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech"> <p class="stage-direction">[_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]</p>  And falsehoods the truths
                of other people.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">  Yes, my lord.</p>

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech">Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
                is oneself.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">Yes, my lord. </p>

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech">To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
                Phipps.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">  Yes, my lord.</p> 

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech"><p class="stage-direction"> [_Looking at himself in the glass_.] </p> Don’t think I quite
                like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
                almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps?</p> 

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech">I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.</p>

            <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p  class="speech"> You don’t, Phipps?</p>

            <h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p  class="speech"> No, my lord.</p>
