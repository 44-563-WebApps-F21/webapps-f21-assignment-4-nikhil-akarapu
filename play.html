            The Library in Lord Goring’s house_.  _An Adam room_.  _On the right is
            the door leading into the hall_.  _On the left_, _the door of the
            smoking-room_.  _A pair of folding doors at the back open into the
            drawing-room_.  _The fire is lit_.  _Phipps_, _the butler_, _is arranging
            some newspapers on the writing-table_.  _The distinction of Phipps is his
            impassivity_. _He has been termed by enthusiasts the Ideal Butler_.  _The
            Sphinx is not so incommunicable_.  _He is a mask with a manner_.  _Of his

        <p>

            LORD GORING.  Got my second buttonhole for me, Phipps? <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  [_Takes his hat_, _cane_, _and cape_, _and
            presents new buttonhole on salver_.] <br>

            LORD GORING.  Rather distinguished thing, Phipps.  I am the only person
            of the smallest importance in London at present who wears a buttonhole. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.  I have observed that.<br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Taking out old buttonhole_.]  You see, Phipps, Fashion is
            what one wears oneself.  What is unfashionable is what other people wear. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord. <br>

            LORD GORING.  Just as vulgarity is simply the conduct of other people. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Putting in a new buttonhole_.]  And falsehoods the truths
            of other people. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord.<br>

            LORD GORING.  Other people are quite dreadful.  The only possible society
            is oneself. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord. <br>

            LORD GORING.  To love oneself is the beginning of a lifelong romance,
            Phipps. <br>

            PHIPPS.  Yes, my lord. <br>

            LORD GORING.  [_Looking at himself in the glass_.]  Don’t think I quite
            like this buttonhole, Phipps.  Makes me look a little too old.  Makes me
            almost in the prime of life, eh, Phipps? <br>

            PHIPPS.  I don’t observe any alteration in your lordship’s appearance.<br>

            LORD GORING.  You don’t, Phipps?<br>

            PHIPPS.  No, my lord.<br>
