    <h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech"> I am not quite sure.  For the future a more trivial
buttonhole, Phipps, on Thursday evenings.</p>

<h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5> <p class="speech"> I will speak to the florist, my lord.  She has had a loss in her
family lately, which perhaps accounts for the lack of triviality your
lordship complains of in the buttonhole.</p>

<h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5> <p class="speech"> Extraordinary thing about the lower classes in Englandâ€”they
are always losing their relations.</p>

<h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p class="speech"> Yes, my lord!  They are extremely fortunate in that respect.</p>

<h5 class="name">LORD GORING.</h5><p class="stage-direction" ></p>[_Turns round and looks at him_.  PHIPPS _remains
impassive_.] </p><p class="speech"> Hum!  Any letters, Phipps?</p>

<h5 class="name">PHIPPS.</h5><p class="speech"> Three, my lord. </p><p class="stage-direction" >[_Hands letters on a salver_.]</p>
